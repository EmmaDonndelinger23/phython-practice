    print("While i've stayed at home, i've practiced the " + instrument + " for " + number1 + " hours every " + day + ". My favorite key signature to play and practice in is " + letter + majorMinor + ". It has " + number2 + " flats and" + number3 + " sharps. I like this key signature because it is " + adjectice1 + " and " + adjective2 + ". I've also gotten awesome at counting time signatures. The time signature I love is " + fraction + ", because it is " + adjective3 + " to count. One instrument I want to learn how to play while i'm at home is " + nameOfInstrument + ", because it is " + adjective4 + " and sounds like a " + noun + ". My " + familyMember + " likes it when I play" + nameOfASong + ", and always gives me a round of applause after my performances! When I return to school, my teacher will be " + adjective5ed + " of how great I am at playing my instrument. My teacher might even think I sound like " + favoriteArtist + "!")
